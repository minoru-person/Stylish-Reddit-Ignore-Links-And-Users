# Stylish-Reddit-Ignore-Links-And-Users

Stylish used for Reddit to ignore sponsors, ignore twitter posts, ignore espn links, ignore skysports links, ignore Users etc.

Thanks to Stylish (https://userstyles.org), Johannes (https://userstyles.org/styles/84353/reddit-hide-sponsored-links) and w3schools.com(http://www.w3schools.com).

Why? 
I was tired of reading endless streams of twitter posts and click bait links on certain subreddits. By using this code I have a custom reddit experience. You can too.
