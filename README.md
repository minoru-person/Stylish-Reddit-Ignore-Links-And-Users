# Stylish-Reddit-Ignore-Links-And-Users

For FireFox

Stylish used for Reddit to ignore non-video posts under the /r/sports subreddit.

Thanks to Stylish (https://userstyles.org), Johannes (https://userstyles.org/styles/84353/reddit-hide-sponsored-links) and w3schools.com(http://www.w3schools.com) for helping me write this code.

Code not working in /r/nfl. Fix it.
