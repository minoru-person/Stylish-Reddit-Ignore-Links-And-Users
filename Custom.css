/*
The following is the code I used when browsing the sports section of Reddit via the Stylish browser extension. 
For more information on stylish, you can check out

Thanks to Johannes. His Stylish browser extensions can be found on
https://userstyles.org/styles/84353/reddit-hide-sponsored-links

I added custom links to Johannes's code to personalise my reddit experience. 

You can modify this code by adding links that you want to ignore.  

div[data-domain="linksYouWantToIgnore.com"]{
  display: none!important;
}

You can ignore posts made by certain redditors by using "data-author". 
E.g. if you want to ignore posts made by author "Dan123it", you would insert this code

div[data-author="Dan123it"] {
    background-color: black !important;
}

It's not pretty.
